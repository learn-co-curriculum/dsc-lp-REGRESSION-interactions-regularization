#### Prerequisite knowledge: 

* Students should be familiar with the basics of multiple linear regression, including the cost function. 

* Students should be able to solve multiple linear regression problems with scikit-learn.

* Students should understand the concepts of:
    * coefficient of determination
    * adjusted coefficient of determination
    * mean squared error 

#### Prerequisite Learn.co material:

[Project: Regression Modeling with the Boston Housing Dataset](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-regression-boston-lab)

#### Learning goals for this lesson:

* Students can define interactions in the context of modeling.  
* Students can use `PolynomialFeatures` from sklearn in Python to create additional polynomial and interaction terms.
* Students can explain the bias-variance tradeoff. 
* Students can explain what Lasso and Ridge Regression are, and how they are used in Regularization.
* Students can use sklearn to fit regularized (Lasso) linear regression models.

#### Misconceptions / Notes

* A common misconception is that when we train models we want them to fit the data perfectly. 
    * We actually want models that can generalize to unseen data!
